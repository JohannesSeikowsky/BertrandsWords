Simple command line vocabulary training based on words used by Bertrand Russel
in "History of Western Philosophy" - Version 0.1

#### how to use
Clone repo like usual, navigate to "bertrands_words" directory, 
run program using python3 - `python3 main.py`

#### how it works
Program shows you words used by Russel - one at a time. For each you can either
move on to the next word, show meaning and example of the currently shown word
or exit program. That's it.

At the start you can set whether you want to see rarer or less rare words
by setting an interval. For instance 99-100 would show you the rarest 1% of words.

#### dependencies
No dependencies if you are fine with just "History of Western Philosophy".
If you want to expand to other books as input, you'll need to nltk to run
the processing scripts. 

#### possible plans
This is a version 0.1 so there are many things that can be improved.
And things that can be added. I haven't decided yet.
